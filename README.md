# PinaPL
PinaPL Is Not A Projet Long

This is a second implementation of a standard neural network. It uses the forward propagation algorithm for computing outputs, and the backward propagation algorithm for learning.

## Classes
The included classes/files are:
- **NeuralNetwork**, the data structure wrapper with the main algorithms
- **Neuron** which represents a simple neuron (or perceptron) and transforms data
- **NeuralConnection** which represents either a connection between two neurons, input and output values, or bias values, and stores data
- **Functions** which contains the composition, activation and cost functions
- **idxParser**, the parser for MNIST dataset
- **PinaPLDefines** and **NeuralNetworkDefines** which contains some usefull macros
- **main**, with the testing functions for the XOR operator and the MNIST dataset
